# 👩‍💼 HR Analytics – Python Data Analysis Project

## 🎯 Project Objective
To analyze human resources data with the goal of identifying key factors behind employee attrition, improving workforce planning, and supporting retention strategies.

## 📌 Key Questions (KPIs)
- 📉 What factors contribute most to employee attrition?
- 💼 Which job roles or departments experience the highest turnover?
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 How do satisfaction scores and work-life balance affect retention?
- 💰 Are there patterns in monthly income or promotions tied to attrition?
- 📊 How does age, gender, or experience impact resignation trends?

## ⚙️ Process
1. 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Managed missing values and encoded categorical fields.
2. 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Investigated trends across employee features.
3. 📊 **Visualization**: Used histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps to find correlations.
4. 🧰 **Tools Used**:
   - Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
   - Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Project Insight
- 🧾 Job roles in sales and HR had comparatively higher attrition.
- ⚠️ Low job satisfaction, limited work-life balance, and lack of promotions strongly correlated with resignations.
- 👩‍💼 Younger employees and those with less experience showed higher churn rates.
- 📉 A significant income gap was observed between retained and resigned staff.

## ✅ Final Conclusion
The analysis reveals multiple workforce risks tied to employee engagement, income equality, and departmental conditions. These insights can help organizations craft better retention policies and improve employee experience through data-driven decisions.
